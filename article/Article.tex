\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Grayscale dilation and erosion are basic transformations of mathemaical
morphology. Used together or with other transformations, they are very useful
tool for image analysis. However, they can be very time consuming, especially
with 3D images, and with large structuring elements. Several algorithms have
been created to decrease the computation time. Most of the time, they are
limited to structuring elements with particular property of shape or size. The
moving histogram algorithm \cite{vandroogenbroeckTalbot96} implemented in this
contribution does not suffer this limitation and so is well suited for usage in
a generalist library like ITK. We also introduce a meta filter designed to
select the best algorithm depending on the image and the structuring element.
This meta filter is also a step toward a soft integration of more efficent
algorithm but limited to some shape of structuring elements like the Van
Herk/Gil-Werman algorithm \cite{vanHerk92,GilWerman93}.

\section{Introduction}

  \subsection{Definition and examples}

Dilation and erosion are performed on all pixels of the image with a (small)
set of neighbors of this pixel.
The dilated value of a pixel in the resulting image is the maximum value
of the neighbors given by the structuring element in the source image.
By duality, the eroded value of a pixel in the resulting image is the
minimum value of the neighbors given by the structuring element in the
source image.

Other transformations are defined in a similar way than dilation and erosion.
While we use maximum or minimum value in a neighborhood to define dilation and
erosion, other transformations can be defined with other statistical values
get from the set of neighbors, like mean, median, sigma, ...

The neighborhood can be not complete on the border of the image. In practice,
we often considere that the border have a defined value, which must be chosen
by the user. The default border value is set to get the same result as the
one we should have if the neighbors outside the image have been discarded\footnote{
It is true only if the structuring element is symetric. If the structuring element
is not symetric, some pixel in the resulting image may get undefined value
if the neighbors outside the image are discarded instead of getting a border
value}.

While interest of grayscale dilation or erosion used alone is not as evident
than in binary case, but used with other transformations, they become very powerfull
tools for image analysis. The following transformations are based on grayscale
erosion and/or dilation:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Black and white top-hats

  \item Grayscale opening and closing

  \item Grayscale opening and closing by reconstruction

  \item Morphological gradients

\end{itemize}


  \subsection{Algorithms review}

The following algorithms will be detailed for dilation, but can be transposed to
erosion just but substituting maximum by minimum.

\begin{itemize}

  \item Basic algorithm

For all pixels of the image, get the values of the neighbors defined by the structuring
element, and assign the maximum value to the corresponding pixel of the output image.
The structuring element can be defined in two ways which impact the complexity of the
algorithm:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the structuring element is defined in a table with the same dimensionality than
the image, and all the value into it define if the neighbor is or is not in the neighborhood.
The algorithm complexity in that case is O(IxT) where I is the image size, and T is the total
size of the structuring element.
    \item the structuring element is defined as a list of offsets to the current output
pixel.
The algorithm complexity in that case is O(IxN) where I is the image size, and N is the
number of neighbors in the structuring element. Note that T >= N.
  \end{itemize}

Both definition have their advantage: while the second one require to check less neighbors
than the first one, it also bring the cost of managing the offsets list. In practice,
the first one will be more efficient with structuring element with a small numbers of
neighbors excluded from the neighborhood, and the second one will be more efficient if
there is lots of neighbors excluded from the neighborhood.

The current implementation of dilation and erosion filters in ITK use this algorithm,
with the first structuring element definition.

  \item Moving histogram

This algorithm try to reduce the complexity of the previous algorithm by maintaining
a data structure which store the values covered by the structuring element. When we go
to the next output pixel, the data structure is updated with the neighbor values removed
and the neighbor values added, and so decrease the number of pixel manipulated for
each output pixel.

!!! Talk about translation, zizag, best dimension !!!

The complexity of this algorithm is O(IxNT) where I is the image size, and NT the number
of pixel values added and removed to the data structure per translation on the best
dimension.
In the worst case, the complexity is O(IxT).

  \item Van Herk/Gil-Werman

  \item Structuring element decomposition

Erosion and dilation can be performed in several step to decrease the computation time.
For example, an erosion of a 2D image by a box of size WxH is equivalent to an erosion
of the same image with a structuring element of size Wx1 followed by an erosion with
a second structuring element of size 1xH. In the case of basic algorithm, the complexity
becomes O(Ix(W+H)) instead of O(IxWXH). In case of moving histogram and van Herk/Gil-Werman
algorithm, the complexity become O(Ix2)

\end{itemize}

\section{Performance}

  \subsection{Impact of the size of the image}

To determine the impact of the size of the image on the performance of the two
algorithms, we have run the tests with different sizes of image, always with
the same structuring element: a disc of radius 5.

The test can be repeated with the command
\verb$./perf_image_size ../images/niece.jpg$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{perf_image_size}
\caption{Impact of image size on performance of the two algorithms.\label{perf_image_size}}
\end{figure}

A close look at Figure \ref{perf_image_size} show that none of the algorithm
have a linear execution time depending on the image size. This non-linearity can
be explained by the optimization of the algorithms in the center of the
image. The higher curvature observed for the basic algorithm show that the
optimization is more efficient for the basic algorithm. This result is
consistent with the analyze of the algorithms: the basic one does no test in the
center of the image while the moving histogram one keeps doing one test per
pixel to determine that further tests can be avoided.

  \subsection{Impact of the size of the structuring element}

Figure \ref{perf2D-total} show that the execution time is linear depending on
the full size of the structuring element (not the number of neighbours in it)
for the basic algorithm, while Figure \ref{perf2D-hnb} show that the execution
time of the moving histogram algorithm is linear depending on the number of
pixel added and removed per translation.

The moving histogram algorithm have a lower complexity for common cases, like
disc or square structuring element.
